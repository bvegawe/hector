This folder includes fortran code to run the BRICK sea-level rise model.
Parameters are passed in from ../slr_brick_component.cpp.
SLR contributions from the BRICK subcomponents, as well as the overall
global SLR, are returned.

./src - Includes all source files

./obs - Includes the observation datasets used to normalize
        subcomponent inputs. Each subcomponent requires temperature
        relative to some time period, and the Antarctic ice sheet
        component requires normalized SLR.

Before using BRICK in Hector, you should -
    - Enter this directory
